  Changes:
    - There is now a Spaceship Victory Condition. Build a high speed spaceship and power a special device to win the game.
    - There are now 4 tiers of Deep space science. Most useful stuff is unlocked in tiers 1 and 2, but tier 4 is required for the spaceship victory.
    - Added some new and unique ways to make data.
    - The final tier of energy science requires sending probes into stars.
    - The final tier of astronomic science requires sending probes around asteroid belts.
    - Some data can only be generated on a moving spaceship.

    - Many deep space science level recipes have been rebalanced.
    - Spaceships now have a streamline mechanic (you may have noticed that this area of space has a lot of rocks), so cut those corners off your box ships for some extra speed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Mixed core fragment (from Nauvis) has reduced vaues for most resources (-50%).
    - Removed setting for electric boiler.

    - Reverted change to belts that prevented items from being dropped on them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.46
  Features:
    - Added 5 tiers of Adaptive armour. Fills a similar role to energy shields with lower power requirements but much slower regeneration. Not as good for sustained combat or skirmishing but has lower tech requirements.
    - Added 6 tiers (4 new tiers) of Energy shield equipment. Energy shields charge quickly but are power hungry. Higher tier versions will be difficult to use effectively until the personal antimatter reactor equipment is added.

  Changes:
    - Code changes required to have hr graphics in a separate mod that is not a required mod.
    - Added cargo rocket silo launch event thanks to MFerrari.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.45
  Features:
    - Added Fuel Refinery structure and technology.
    - Added Rocket fuel from water recipe.

  Changes:
    - Added empty barrel scrapping recipe.
    - Solid fuel recipes and rocket fuel recipes are now part of fuel refining, this will break you existing solid fuel setups.
    - Fuel refining recipes have had their crafting times have been reduced to 1/4, the fuel refinery is effectively 4 times faster but keeps a crafting speed of 1 to keep tooltips simple.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a problem with spaceship launch sequence when integrity stress exceeded maximum.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.44

  Bugfixes:
    - Switched Fluid Burner Generators graphics back to SR (fixed) versions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.43
  Bugfixes:
    - Quick fix: Normal resolution Fluid Burner Generator sprites didn't process correctly, switching to hr Fluid Burner Generators graphics for all resolutions as a temporary workaround.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.42
  Features:
    - Added Antimatter Reactors. Antimatter can be manufactured where there is abundant energy (like a star), and used to power somewhere energy poor (like deep space).
    - Added Fluid Burner Generators. Can burn fluid with an energy value to generate electricity. Simple and compact but lacks the energy efficiency of steam setups. Allows spaceships to burn rocket fuel for power.

  Changes:
    - Renamed supercomputer MK2 and MK3 to Quantum supercomputer and Neural supercomputer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.41
  Changes:
    - There are now 4 tiers of medpack.

    - Meteor point defence does not require explosives.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.40
  Changes:
    - Meteors that fall in water don't leave remnants.
    - Inventory filters, logistic request slots, and auto-trash filters are saved on death so your successor is created with the same settings.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed meteor alert having completely wrong structure totals.

  Locale:
    - Added string for se-core-miner-drill

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.39
  Changes:
    - Supercomputers can now be upgraded in place.

  Bugfixes:
    - Added missing unlock for bio combustion data.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.38
  Changes:
    - Changed planet core mining to use a different method that does not require continuous updates via script. They are now like electric mining drills and output in the same way. You may need to remove inserters and add belts to collect the fragments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.37
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed meteor point defence being unplaceable in space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Changes:
    - Reduced satellite accumulator and solar panel cost
    - Reduced space capsule accumulator and solar panel cost

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.34
  Features:
    - Added Meteor point defence, a cheaper more basic meteor defence option. Has limited range, but can fire 4 times and has a much lower power requirement.
    - Added custom meteor event sound.
    - Added a custom alert for meteors so it does not make the annoying sound that happens when something gets printed to the console.
    - Added a per-player setting for meteor alerts to be printed to the console (so you can look back later to see stats, but you get the annoying noise), off by default.

  Changes:
    - Space science is now required on average 1 tech later in many tech lines.
    - Rocket silo research is now cheaper and faster.
    - Meteor defence installation accuracy reduced to 80%.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.33
  Bugfixes:
    - Improved the on/off flicker of space science labs but it is still not perfect. The graphics still need to be redone to remove the flicker completely, but the graphics need to be updated anyway to remove the pipes.
    - Fixed that cargo pods couldn't be placed in space, and therefore would be destroyed by the game engine if the tile under them was changed while in space.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.32
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed supercomputer in SR using HR graphics that got cut off.

  Locale:
    - Added zh-CN translation by Frost.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.29
  Info:
    - IMPORTANT: Compatibility patches and a few other things are being moved to a separate mod (space-exploration-postprocess). It is required, but I can't list it as a dependency. Please make sure you install it when updating (assuming you read changelogs).
    - Moved all graphics to a separate package (also required but I can list it as a dependency without causing a dependency loop). This is to allow people to download code updates without repeatedly downloading 200MB of images.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.28
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed that particle accelerator had become impossible to research after shuffling some things around.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.27
  Changes:
    - Increased minimum random planet size.
    - If additional fluid resources are added by mods the omni core fragment is restricted to 4 fluids, water is removed first.

  Scripting:
    - Updated remote interface: begin_meteor_shower. Can now specify number of data.meteors along with data.entity or (data.zone_name and data.position)
    - Added remote interface: get_zone_from_name requires data.zone_name
    - Added remote interface: get_zone_from_surface_index requires data.surface_index

    - Fixed that meteors showers get stuck in pairs instead of the chances: 50% 1, 25% 2, 12.5% 3, 6.25% 4, etc...
