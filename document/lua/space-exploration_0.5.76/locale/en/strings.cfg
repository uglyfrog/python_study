page_space_exploration_text_1=Welcome to Space Exploration. There's a lot in the mod already, but it is still [font=default-bold]experimental[/font] status and is under heavy development. There may be bugs.\n\n[font=heading-2]Experimental status?[/font]\n\nSpace Exploration is still changing rapidly and I am putting all my time into progressing the development of the key features at the expense of mod compatibility. [color=red]It is not advisable to play with mods other than the required and recommended mods.[/color]\n\nWhile in experimental status: If a mod causes problems such as corrupted game/save state, crashes, invalid tech trees, or core gameplay it will quickly be marked as incompatible to protect new players. This means if you use a lot of mods it is more likely one may be marked as incompatible later due to an issue you had not yet discovered. You are of course free to edit your info.json file to try incompatible mods but you do so at your own risk: if your game state becomes unplayable because of it I won't be able to help you.\n\nWhile in experimental status: Most other overhaul mods are marked as incompatible if the tech tree is significantly broken, however the long term intention is to get the mods working together to the satisfaction of both developers. Krastorio 2 is an example of this work already substantially underway.\n\nThere is some additional information relating to mod compatibility on the Space Exploration wiki. If you would like to assist with mod compatibility please reach out on Discord, but please also be aware that it is not a high priority until later in Space Exploration's development.\n\n[font=heading-2]Recommended mods[/font] \n\n • AAI Containers & Warehouses. Gives you some larger containers that match the vanilla theme.\n\n • Module Inserter Allows you to put modules in machines from satellite mode.\n\n • Equipment Grid Logistic Module A module for vehicle grids, like the spidertron, to request items from the network and dispose of trash.\n\n • Grappling Gun Allows you to jump over buildings, across lakes, and out of combat if you get slowed. In space you can get back to space platform if you fall off. Also lets you board spaceships (especially useful if they are moving).\n\n • Burner Leech This is just for the AAI burner phase.\n\n • Text Plates Allows you to put text on the ground, useful for marking planet names, station names, spaceship docking zones, etc.\n\n • Even Distribution Helps early game when you manually insert items into multiple buildings.\n\n • Combat Mechanics Overhaul can help with defences when off planet if you enable the "Walls Block Spitters" option. It is cheaper to repair walls than turrets.\n\n • Bullet Trails So you can see where your bullets are going, or what gun turrets are shooting at. (Also looks better.)\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Recommended settings[/font]\n\nYou MUST have all alien biomes terrain tiles enabled, otherwise the game will crash at a later point.\n\nAs the game is longer than normal, it is a good idea to start a game with low enemy evolution factors.\n\nYou should not set high resources settings for your starting planet unless you are playing with resource intensive recipes, such as high difficulty recipes or marathon mode. If resources are set too high it will reduce the need to expand to other planets.\n\n\n[font=heading-2]Helpful urls[/font]\n\nTake a look at the Space Exploration Wiki over here: https://spaceexploration.miraheze.org\n\nGet help or follow the development on Discord: https://discord.gg/ymjUVMv\n\nOver 2000 hours have gone into this mod.

menu_meteor_defence=[img=virtual-signal/se-meteor] Meteor Defence
title_meteor_defence=Meteor Defence
page_meteor_defence_text_1=Meteors hit most zones at random intervals. You can change the max interval between strikes in mod settings.\n\nThe number of meteors is also random, 50% for 1, 25% for 2, 12.5% for 3, 6.25% for 4, etc...\n\nThe meteor defence structures can shoot at meteors. They fire in sequence, so later defences won't fire if all the meteors were destroyed. Defences require ammo, charge time, and additional power while charging. The power draw is not insignificant, so it is wise to balance risk against cost.
menu_coremining=[img=item/se-core-miner] Core Mining
title_coremining=Core Mining
page_coremining_text_1=Core mining can only be done on planets and moons. Each planet and moon can give a different type of core fragment depending on what is inside. Nauvis gives a balance of common resources but other places tend to mainly give 1 resource type. Core miners are power hungry, but you do get some energy back from the coal, oil, and uranium.\n\nCore miners use a lot of power, plus each core miner you place on a planet reduces the efficiency of all core miners on that same planet. They are much less power efficient than normal miners even if you have multiple running, but they never run out of resources. In the early game it can be useful to have 1 core miner running when you have excess power. If you start on a tiny planet, then solar and core mining might be your only way to get enough resources to get off the planet.\n\nLate game core miners benefit greatly from mining productivity bonuses. It is better to aim for a few on many planets rather than many on a few planets.
menu_beacons=[img=item/se-wide-beacon-2] Beacons
title_beacons=Beacons
page_beacons_text_1=[font=heading-2]Beacon Overload [img=virtual-signal/se-beacon-overload][/font]\n\nBeacon Overload is an overhaul of Beacon mechanics in Factorio. Crafting machines can only be affected by 1 beacon, if affected by more beacons they overload and pause production.\n\nThe overhaul allows more modules in beacons and promotes the use of more powerful Modules in both beacons and assemblers for maximum bonuses. The change also allows and promotes a wider range of factory designs.\n\nThe Basic Beacon is individually much more powerful than a vanilla beacon, but cannot stack their effects on one machine so the maximum boost you can provide is reduced compared to vanilla. The more powerful beacons are able to far exceed the maximum boost on a machine available in Vanilla.\n\nStarting from Wide Area Beacon players can experience substantial amount in module savings as well as freedom to create complex design revolving around larger buildings or with multiple fluid or material inputs.\n\nMachines affected by more than one beacon will be marked with a Beacon Overload icon and pause all production. They will still continue to consume minimal power in the process.
menu_launching_satellites=[img=item/satellite] Launching Satellites
title_launching_satellites=Launching Satellites
page_launching_satellites_text_1=You have launched [color=cyan]__1__[/color] satellites.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=virtual-signal/se-remote-view] Navigation Satellite Uplink [__CONTROL__se-remote-view__][/font]\n\nWhen you launch a Navigation Satellite into space from the Satellite Rocket Silo, you get access to the [img=virtual-signal/se-remote-view] Navigation Satellite View. This mode can be accessed with the [__CONTROL__se-remote-view__] key. While in satellite mode your camera is detached from your character so you can quickly look around the map and even uncover new areas. There are some things you can't do in satellite mode, like directly place or mine entities. There is a lot you can do though, like use blueprints, deconstruction planners, place ghost entities, order wire connections, change machine recipes, combinator settings, etc.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit]Universe Explorer [__CONTROL__se-universe-explorer__][/font]\n\nThe Navigation Satellite network also lets you view other surfaces, like other planets, moons, asteroid belts, asteroid fields, and orbits. Press [__CONTROL__se-universe-explorer__] to bring up the list of known zones. If you have launched a satellite then you can click View Surface to see what is there. It can be good to scout a planet a bit before you try to fly there.\n\nLaunching satellites also helps with zone discovery within the system it is launched from (see Zone Discovery for more details).\n\n[font=heading-2][img=item/se-satellite-telemetry] Satellite Telemetry[/font]\n\nSatellite launches return satellite telemetry, a vital component in [img=item/se-rocket-science-pack] Rocket Science.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=item/se-space-probe-rocket] Space probes[/font]\n\nThe space [img=item/se-space-probe-rocket-silo] Space probe rocket silo is not a satellite rocket silo but is designed for use in space. Instead of building rocket is launches pre-built [img=item/se-space-probe-rocket] Space probe rockets. A space probe rocket is much cheaper than a normal satellite rocket, and it can pre-assembled in a manufacturing hub instead of brining resources to the rocket silo. A Space probe rocket silo can launch satellites cheaply, but can also launch more specialised probes and collectors from specific locations in space.

page_pinned_locations_text_1=After unlocking the [img=virtual-signal/se-remote-view] Navigation Satellite View, you gain access to Pinned Locations, a tool for quickly swapping to different parts of your factory across all of the surfaces that you've explored.\n\nLocations can be pinned with the plus button in the Navigation Satellite window. You may set hotkeys for Pinned Locations when adding or editing them.

If there is nothing else to discover in that system then it can discover new stars instead, but cannot discover anything orbiting other stars or anything in deep space.\n\n[font=heading-2]Zone Discovery Research[/font]\nYou can use space telescopes to look for new zones to discover. This is achieved through "Zone Discover" research. The basic zone discovery research can find a random star, planet, moon, or asteroid belt.\n\n[font=heading-2]Targeted Zone Discovery Research[/font]\nTargeted zone discovery research is the same as the basic research, but if you have selected a resource preference (below) it looks in areas more likely for that resource to occur so you are more likely to discover a zone with that resource. Keep in mind that a planet can't be discovered before discovering its star, and a moon can't be discovered before discovering its planet. Don't expect to find what you're looking for every time.\n\n[font=heading-2]Deep Space Zone Discovery Research[/font]\nDeep space zone discovery research only looks for areas of interest in deep space and is the only way you can discover asteroid fields.

menu_cargo_rockets=[img=virtual-signal/se-cargo-rocket] Cargo Rockets
title_cargo_rockets=Cargo Rockets
page_cargo_rockets_text_1=Cargo rockets are launched from a Cargo Rocket Silo, aka the Launchpad.\n\nYou have launched [color=cyan]__1__[/color] cargo rockets.\n\nYour cargo loss modifier based on technology: Loss max percentage reduced by [color=cyan]__2__%[/color].\n\nYour rocket survivability modifier based on technology: Loss chance reduced by [color=cyan]__3__%[/color].\n\nYour rocket reusability modifier based on technology: [color=cyan]__4__[/color] +/- up to 10 (max 100) parts recovered.\n\n[font=heading-2]Getting Started[/font]\n\nBefore you can launch cargo rockets, you need to have launched a satellite in the satellite rocket (the standard Factorio aka 'vanilla' silo) while Space Exploration is installed. \n\nOnce you have built a cargo rocket silo you need to build and fuel your rocket:\n\n  • 100 cargo rocket sections into the inventory. 20 of these will be recovered from the rocket at the destination, more with the right research. \n  • 1 space capsule into the inventory. This will always be recovered at the destinations and can return you home from orbit.\n  • A lot of liquid rocket fuel, piped into one of the 8 connections near the corners. The amount of fuel required depends on the radius of the planet you're launching from and the distance to the destination. If using the "Any landing pad with name" destination option, it will load enough fuel for any of the valid destinations.\n\nYou can enter the cargo rocket silo from the door at the front (press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__). This will let you ride with the rocket. You should also have a thrustersuit and lifesupport canisters so you don't die if you are launching to space. \n\nYour first rocket won't have anywhere to land so it will disassemble as the cargo is released. Sometimes rockets targeting a landing pad miss and the rocket crashes. Even in the case of a crash the cargo is deployed in cargo pods so you never lose all of the cargo. \n\nYou should take a Rocket Landing Pad and some Space Platform Scaffold with you so you can build somewhere for the next rocket to land.\n\nBuilding a Rocket Landing Pad at your base before launching will allow you to easily return directly there instead of ending up in a random location when you return.\n\n[font=heading-2]Destinations[/font]\n\nOnce you have a landing pad placed, make sure you update the destination of the rocket silo to target the landing pad and not a random point in orbit. You can do this in-person or via the Satellite Remote View (hotkey 'n'). However, rockets will not launch to a landing pad that contains items, so make sure to empty it.\n\nMore distant destinations have less reliable delivery. Some destination types, such as asteroid fields have additional safety penalties, but these can be mitigated with research.\n\n[font=heading-2]Basic Automation[/font]\n\nThe rocket silo outputs signals for how many parts are already in the rocket. You can put a condition on an inserter of [Cargo Rocket Sections < 100] to make sure it won't fill the rocket with additional sections.\n\nIf you have set up launch triggers on a silo it will launch automatically, but a rocket won't automatically launch to a landing pad that isn't empty (otherwise the cargo might not fit).\n\nIf you select the destination as "Any landing pad with name", then it will search for all landing pads with the matching name on any surface. Carefully named landing pads combined with the inability to launch to a landing pad that is not empty can result in an easy to set up rocket logistic system.\n\n[font=heading-3]Input Signals[/font]\n\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-green] Green signal: Can trigger a launch if the silo is configured to have a trigger that uses the green signal.\n\n[font=heading-3]Output Signals[/font]\n\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-E] E Signal: Empty slots\n\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-F] F Signal: Full slots\n\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-L] L Signal: Liquid rocket fuel required for all potential destinations specified by the destinations setting.\n\n[img=virtual-signal/se-cargo-rocket] Cargo Rocket Signal: If the rocket is complete (i.e. 1 capsule and 100 rocket sections) then a value of 1 is returned.\n\n[img=item/se-space-capsule] Space Capsule Signal: Any capsules used in the rocket construction are added to the count of any capsules in the cargo inventory.\n\n[img=item/se-cargo-rocket-section] Cargo Rocket Section Signal: Any sections used in the rocket construction are added to the count of any sections in the cargo inventory.\n\n[img=fluid/se-liquid-rocket-fuel] Liquid Rocket Fuel Signal: The total liquid rocket fuel in the silo.
menu_delivery_cannons=[img=item/se-delivery-cannon] Delivery Cannons
title_delivery_cannons=Delivery Cannons
page_delivery_cannons_text_1=Delivery cannons are explosion-assisted railguns with interplanetary range. They are designed to fire sturdy homogeneous resources that can survive the sudden acceleration. They cannot fire more complicated manufactured intermediates or structures.\n\nA delivery cannon only has a target point, it does not have any understanding of what is at that point and will fire the payload as long as it has power and a filled delivery capsule. If you want to add conditions to the cannon’s ability to fire, you restrict the cannon’s ability to load resources or capsules.\n\nWhen a delivery capsule lands on the ground it damages the area and most of the resources are destroyed. A delivery cannon chest can safely catch the capsule as long as the chest is not full. You can have multiple cannons firing at the same chest with different resources.\n\nIt is advisable to either keep targeted chests empty, or restrict cannon inputs using signal transmission.\n\nDelivery cannons have a 1GJ capacity and draw 50MW when charging. The range of the delivery cannon is constrained by the amount of energy it can store. Firing at more distant locations takes more energy. Some destinations may require more energy than the delivery cannon can hold so it will never fire. You can set up a delivery cannon relay station in a location half way there to send the cargo in 2 stages.
menu_steam_power=[img=item/se-big-turbine] Steam Power
title_steam_power=Steam Power
page_steam_power_text_1=The steam power system in Space Exploration is greatly expanded. There are new ways to generate heat and steam, and new ways to consume steam to create electric power.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=item/se-electric-boiler] Electric Boilers[/font]\n\nWhile the Boiler can only produce steam using fuel sources, the Electric boiler produces steam using electricity. The steam produced by the Electric boiler contains less energy than the electricity used to turn the water to steam, so it is not useful for normal power production and can't be used for an infinite energy loop. Instead the steam can be stored in storage tanks, saving the energy so that it can be used in energy production later. This can offer higher capacity energy storage than accumulators of the same cost, but is less energy efficient than accumulators. Higher temperature steam is even more space efficient.\n\nThe Electric boiler can make lower temperature steam for use in recipes that require steam but don't care about the temperature, or boil away water just to get rid of it.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=item/se-condenser-turbine] Condenser Turbines[/font]\n\nSome places in Space Exploration lack any natural sources of water (ex. orbits or waterless planets). In these locations using steam power with Steam turbines may seem futile, since the constant stream of water required by Steam turbines could not all be supplied from off world sources. In these cases Condenser turbines come in incredibly handy. Condenser turbines act just like a normal Steam turbine with one key difference: rather than exhausting the incoming steam into the atmosphere, the steam is condensed back down into water and output from the turbine. This lets Condenser turbines be used in a (mostly) closed loop where only small amounts of water are required to top off the system. Do note that Condenser turbines are a little less power efficient than Steam turbines, meaning that you will get slightly less power out of the same amount of heat when run through Condenser turbines instead of Steam turbines; this is the tradeoff for recovering the water.\n\n[font=heading-2][img=item/se-big-turbine] High Temperature Steam[/font]\n\nAt a certain point, using steam to create vast amounts of power starts to become unwieldy due to the number of Steam turbines required. To circumvent this scaling problem, high temperature steam may be used as a replacement. Produced by High temperature heat exchangers, and consumed by High temperature turbine generators, high temperature steam is incredibly energy dense. It can be used to dramatically shrink the size of steam power production. In order to use High temperature heat exchangers, a source of heat is required. Nuclear reactors cannot get hot enough to work with High temperature heat exchangers. Instead either an Energy beam receiver or an Antimatter reactor must be used as the heat source. Standard Heat pipes are not capable of transfering high temperature heat; only Naquium heat pipes are capable of transfering high temperature heat. This means that until Naquium heat pipes are available, the High temperature heat exchangers must be placed directly next to the source of the high temperature heat.
menu_lifesupport=[img=item/se-lifesupport-equipment-1] Lifesupport

page_lifesupport_text_1=Lifesupport is gained from lifesupport equipment and lifesupport canisters. You need both to survive in hostile environments.\n\nLifesupport equipment and the consumable canisters can be made in a lifesupport facility.\n\nLifesupport canisters provide the resources needed by the system to fulfil all of its roles and are consumed gradually. As the lifesupport bar decreases, new canisters are consumed directly from your inventory. \n\nLifesupport equipment is placed into the grid of armor, however if you are using a thrustersuit, it has 1 lifesupport equipment built in. Additional lifesupport equipment pieces placed in the equipment grid increase the lifesupport efficiency. If you are using lifesupport equipment in a non-thruster suit then it will protect you on hostile planets but won’t protect you from the vacuum of space.\n\n[font=heading-2]Hostile environments[/font]\nHostile environments are any area that would cause damage to your body just by being there. Lifesupport equipment is designed to protect you from these hazards by providing you with appropriate pressurisation, oxygen, water, nutrition, thermal regulation, and radiation protection. The 2 main types of hostile environment are:\n\nSpace: A space suit (thruster suit) is required for lifesupport to function correctly in a vacuum. You cannot use lifesupport from some other type of armor in space, you will still suffocate.\n\nLand: Certain planets and moons may have dangers such as radiation, extreme cold, extreme heat, or an acidic atmosphere, and require lifesupport equipment. (Coming soon). Planets also require lifesupport if certain bio weapons are used (Plague Worlds). Lifesupport for these areas can be provided by a thruster suit, or by equipment placed into any other type of armor.

It can only be made in space so you need to establish a small space station to produce it. Rocket science packs and the later science packs can only be used in space, so you'll need to rocket up other science packs too and put them in the powerful Space science lab.\n\n[font=heading-2]Specialist Sciences[/font]\n\nThe 4 specialist sciences are Astronomic, Biological, Energy and Material. They are all data-driven, and follow a process of performing experiments to gather data for supercomputers to build an increasingly accurate model of life, the universe, and everything. They are all at approximately the same tech levels so you are free to choose your order of development, however, each one requires a specific resource to some degree, so take a look at your solar system before deciding which science to research first.\n\n[img=item/se-astronomic-science-pack-4] Astronomic science focuses mainly on space logistics.\n\n[img=item/se-energy-science-pack-4] Energy science is mainly in energy production, power transfer, and high tech gadgets.\n\n[img=item/se-material-science-pack-4] Material science is focused more on heavy industry and direct upgrades.\n\n[img=item/se-biological-science-pack-4] Biological science is focused on character upgrades, medicine, lifesupport, bioweapons, and productivity.\n\n[font=heading-2]Deep Space Science[/font]\n\n[img=item/se-deep-space-science-pack-1]Deep space science is focused on exploring the interstellar void, antimatter, and warping spacetime.\n\n[font=heading-2]Tips & Tricks[/font]\n\nSpace science production speed and efficiency is increased drastically by unlocking better recipes. Pay attention to alternate recipes that you unlock, in particular the simulation and insight recipes.\n\nA high productivity bonuses in Space science labs is important, it is worth exploring options for the best bonuses.\n\nYou are more likely to be constrained by the speed that you can design new systems than the resource requirements. Don't try to build too big. Bootstrap something simple together first. If you have researded all the tech that you can then you should probably work on the next science pack instead of increasing production.\n\nYou may be able to delay increasing your resource infrastructure until you reach Tier 4 space sciences.\n\nBetter modules and better beacons make a huge difference to production speed.
menu_energy_beams=[img=item/se-energy-transmitter-emitter] Energy Beams
title_energy_beams=Energy Beams
page_energy_beams_text_1=[font=heading-2]Coronal Mass Ejections[/font]\nStars in the area frequently eject dangerous streams of particles. It is not uncommon for a planet or moon to stray into one of these particle streams. If you have a large base on an affected surface you should evacuate, diversify or disperse your assets, or build an Umbrella defence facility with a large accumulator backup. If you have a small base it is fairly likely to go unscathed. When a surface is threatened there will be at least 4 hours early warning. Known threats will be listed below.
page_energy_beam_warning_text=[img=virtual-signal/se-star] Warning: Coronal mass ejection heading for __1__.\nEstimated defence requirements: __3__ GW peak power, __4__GJ over 120 seconds. ETA: __2__s.
page_energy_beams_text_2=[font=heading-2]Umbrella: Energy Beam Defence[/font]\nThe energy beam defence facility, "Umbrella", can protect against coronal mass ejections and space-based energy beam weapons. It works by levitating magnetic particles into a protective bubble, then realigns and clumps the particles as needed to diffuse hostile energy beams. The only requirement to function is energy, the base draw is 10MW but increases based on the strength of attacking beams. Only 1 is needed per surface against Coronal mass ejections, against energy beams weapons 1 Umbrella can defend against up to 500GW of attacking power. For a coronal mass ejection, the base power requirement for a 5000 radius planet and 100% solar, is expected be around 160GJ over 2 minutes with a peak power draw of 2GW at the 1 minute mark. This is increased or decreased with the zone's solar power multiplier, and for solid bodies it is increased or decreased based on the radius relative to a base radius of 5000. For an energy beam from an Energy Beam Emitter, the power requirement is expected to be 1/10th of the energy beam strength at the target (after efficiency loss).\n\n[font=heading-2]Energy Beaming[/font]\nThe Energy Beam emitter is capable of sending energy to different surface. It can do this in 2 main ways, either as a way to provide power to a distant surface, "Energise", or as a cutting beam weapon, "Glaive". When in Glaive mode the beam damages an area continuously but can be moved over the target surface cutting a path. The damage rate, area, and beam speed increase based on the energy put into the beam. "Auto-Glaive" mode has autonomous target selection.\n\nAn Energy beam emitter has 4 connection points where Energy beam chambers can connect end-on. Energy beam chambers can connect length-ways, or have a long edge meet the middle of a short edge, but cannot connect directly side-to-side. Energy beam injectors attach directly to the sides of Energy beam chambers. Each Energy beam injector increases the power of the connected Energy beam emitter. To collect power from a beam you need an Energy beam receiver at the target surface and select it as the target using the targeter from the emitter. Once the beam has the receiver as the target the receiver will heat up. The heat can be taken from heat connections at the side to power heat exchangers and turbines.
menu_spaceships=[img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship] Spaceships
title_spaceships=Spaceships
page_spaceships_text_1=Spaceships are huge, powerful vehicles that can launch many contained structures, items, and players into space, then rocket around the solar system to land on other surfaces.\n\n[font=heading-2]Spaceship Construction[/font]\nSpaceships are made from many tiles and smaller components that fit together to make a spaceship of your own design. You design a spaceship almost like a mini moveable base.\n\nStart with a floorplan of spaceship flooring. Don't build too big, as your first few spaceships will have strict size restrictions, expandable by research. Place spaceship walls around the edges to make bulkheads, and make sure there are no gaps (including diagonals). Place a spaceship console somewhere in the inside, this is the core part of the spaceship and how you control it. When the console is placed, there are some pulses as the console figures out what parts are properly attached, what parts are properly contained and what will fall off if you try to launch. If any squares flash red, then there is an issue with your design, which you can diagnose by checking the spaceship console. You also need a spaceship rocket booster tank, and a spaceship rocket engine. The booster tank is what stores the fuel you need to get into space and provides the VTOL component. The rocket engines are for the slower burn through space to get you to your destination. Some form of defence in the front (always north) is also advisable because the nebula you are in is full of debris.\n\n[font=heading-2]Integrity Stress[/font]\nEarly on, you will be very limited on spaceship size by the Integrity Stress limits of your technology level. Additional technology lets you build larger spaceships. Integrity stress is calculated in 2 parts:\n\nPart A. Hull stress mainly based on the size and shape of the ship.\nPart B. Container stress based on the item and fluid storage capacity of the ship.\n\nThe total integrity stress is whichever stress factor is larger, the two values are not added together. If your structural stress is 250 and your container stress is 280, the integrity stress will be 280.\n\nThe Hull stress bar shows 3 values. The first is the current discounted hull stress based on empty spaceship tiles. Up to 10% of a ship's size does not count towards integrity stress if it is empty spaceship tiles. This clear space is discounted in the stress calculation and is useful for corridors. The second value is the hull stress with no discount and is useful to estimate the ship stress value you would have if you fill the interior with structures. The third value is the max stress your tech level will allow.\n\nExceptionally long thin ships, or ships with very thin sections in the middle are less sturdy than more rotund designs. Wide ships are sturdy but must clear more asteroids.\n\nSome structures have special effects on the ship integrity or speed, such as the Nexus.\n\n[font=heading-2]Streamlining[/font]\nThis area of space is in a gritty nebula. If you streamline your spaceship you can improve you spaceship's maximum speed by around 30%. Making a flat box front should be avoided, but don't need to build a wedge. Up to 1/3 of your spaceship's front can be flat with no penalty. Circular shapes should also be fine. You can manually trigger an integrity check to see how the streamlining is going.\n\n[font=heading-2]Speed[/font]\nShip speed is based on the thrust of the engines vs the ship weight (approximated by integrity stress). Engines can be placed in/on the ship, but engines at the back of the ship with empty space behind are more effective. Fully enclosed engines are 60% effective. Engines at the edge of the ship also have a slight advantage.\n\nYou can set a target speed for the ship to aim for. If the ship exceeds the target speed then it will start disabling engines to more closely match the target speed and save fuel. There are 3 speed limit options, so you can further reduce your speed for high asteroid areas that might otherwise overwhelm your defences.\n\n[font=heading-2]Long Haul Activities[/font]\nWhen considering long distance travel, it is worth noting that you can do a lot in satellite mode while your body is in transit. You can also give orders to spaceships remotely via the satellite uplink.\n\n[font=heading-2]Crafting Machines[/font]\n[color=#ffaaaa]Warning: A crafting machine designed for space will only be able to use recipes shared by other land structures if the spaceship is on land. If a space-based recipe is set while the spaceship lands, the ingredients will be lost. Some land-based crafting machines can function in space, but they will lose the ability to use productivity modules while in space. If the spaceship launches with productivity modules in these machines, the productivity modules are destroyed.[/color]\n\n[font=heading-2]Spaceship Signals[/font]\nThe top right section of the spaceship console can be connected with wires separately from the main structure, as it outputs its own signals:\n[img=item/se-spaceship-console] The console number indicates the spaceship's ID.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] The speed signal number indicates the spaceship's speed: -1 if stopped, -2 if anchored.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-distance] The distance signal indicates the distance to the selected destination: -1 if arrived, -2 if anchored, -3 if no destination is set.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] A fourth signal indicates the current destination, if any.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-D] Certain parts of space have more or less asteroids that your ship will encounter. The density of asteroids where the ship is currently positioned is indicated with the D signal.\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-A] If the spaceship is anchored then it indicates the anchored zone id with the A signal.\n\n[font=heading-2]Spaceship Automation[/font]\nThe main structure of the console can accept signal inputs on the left side:\n[img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] The speed signal sets a target speed and engages the engines. A negative signal stops the engines instead.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship-launch] A Spaceship launch signal triggers a launch.\n[img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] A destination signal sets the destination (you can see a zone's signal from the Universe Explorer side panel once you have constructed a spaceship).\n\nNote: Both the destination signal's type (ex. [img=virtual-signal/se-planet-orbit] or [img=virtual-signal/se-asteroid-belt]) and the signal's value/id must match for the destination to be set.\n\nNote: A spaceship console will not accept [img=virtual-signal/se-spaceship-launch] Launch or [img=virtual-signal/signal-speed] Speed inputs until a player has manually launched and engaged the ship at least once. This is to prevent blueprinted spaceships from accidentally launching while still in the middle of being built by bots.\n\nNote: The console only checks for changes to the input signal every second; a sustained signal is required for the ship to react, single tick pulses will not work.\n\n[font=heading-2]Circuit Signal Passthrough[/font]\nSpaceship clamps have a power and circuit network connection point in their upper corner. When clamps are connected during automatic landing, the power and circuit network signals are joined, allowing for power and circuit signals to be passed between the ship and the landing location.\n\n[font=heading-2]Automatic Landing[/font]\nTo cause a spaceship to land, the console must be given a pair of anchor signals, either:\n"anchor using left clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp]) with "anchor to right clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-right-clamp])\n"anchor using right clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-right-clamp]) with "anchor to left clamp" ([img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-left-clamp])\n\nThe value of the "anchor using ..." signal must match the value of a clamp on the ship.\nThe value of the "anchor to ..." signal must match the value of a clamp at the destination.\nYou can see and change these values on clamps by opening a clamp's UI. If a match is found for both the "anchor using ..." and "anchor to ..." signals given to the ship console, then the ship will try to land with the two clamps connected. Use with caution.\n\n[font=heading-2]Clamps[/font]\nTo set the ID of a clamp, open the clamp GUI and change the numeric value of the clamp signal to the ID you wish for the clamp to have. You never need to change the type of the clamp signal.\n\nYou can disable an anchored clamp by passing it a red signal.\n\n[font=heading-2]Landing Example[/font]\nThe spaceship has a left-clamp with ID 315. In that clamp's GUI the signal is [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp] with a value of 315.\nThe landing surface has a right-clamp with ID 147. In that clamp's GUI the signal is [img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-right-clamp] with a value of 147.\nIn order to get the spaceship to land using those two clamps, the left side of the ship console must be passed the following signals:\n[img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-using-left-clamp] 315\n[img=virtual-signal/se-anchor-to-right-clamp] 147

page_arcospheres_text_1=Arcospheres are near perfect spheres of nano-engineered naquium crystal. They are of unknown origin, but are most commonly found floating deep in interstellar space.\n\nEach one encompasses an extra-dimensional knot in space time and allows you to interact with a small 4th spatial dimension. The spheres can be polarised so that they can manipulate certain aspects of space time if moved relative to one another. Sets of specific arcospheres can be used to warp and weave spacetime into higher dimensions. \n\n[font=heading-2]Usage[/font]\nArcospheres are the most unique production challenge in the game. They are used as tools in recipes but are never destroyed, they are only altered. The main challenge in their use is cycling through the spheres you have so you don’t end up running out of a specific type. There are many ways to balance production, but a few combinators can help a lot. If you get stuck ask for hints on Discord, or find more info on the space exploration wiki.\n\n[font=heading-2]Collection[/font]\nArcospheres are found by launching an Arcosphere collector from an asteroid field. Repeated launches have diminishing returns. You might get better returns by launching from different asteroid fields.

The debris pattern makes it look like it was cut in half and/or collided with the ring structure. It may be worth salvaging.

page_journal_text_found_gate_ship_authenticated=The derelict ship in the anomaly scanned me and "authenticated my biosignature". I don't know if that means it has a record of me specifically somehow, or maybe just that any random cybernetic human is good enough when compared to biters and genocidal robots.

page_journal_title_spaceship_victory=Spaceship Victory
page_journal_spaceship_victory=I built an extremely fast and powerful spaceship and activated the distortion drive. It took a while for the drive to stabilise into a practical FTL state, but once it did I was able to enter cryosleep for the subsequent journey home, to a galaxy far far away. I leave behind an autonomous interstellar empire built from the ground up by my own hand. My legacy in this space will live on.
page_journal_title_gate_victory=Ancient Gate Victory
page_journal_gate_victory=The huge ring artifact, an ancient intergalactic gate, was eventually repaired to the best of my ability. With some heavy jury rigging and ingenuity I finally managed to get it working. I anchored the distortion field to the local stars, decoded the non-numeric glyph coordinate system, and reverse engineered the dialling system. My mind feels warped by such alien concepts, but it works and I have finally made a portal home. The trip home, to a galaxy far far away took but a moment. I leave behind an autonomous interstellar empire, built from the ground up by my own hand. My legacy in this space will live on.
